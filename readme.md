# All Gorilla tag Modding Discord Hats
> Note that some hats might have been removed or changed to mitigate conflicts that might result in errors in-game.
> The curated folder is there to serve users with the hats thought to be of highest quality and good standard. Things like filesize, default material, sound and firstperson visibility are checked. 

You can either download the GitHub hats repo directly or [download the release zip](https://github.com/GreenMan36/AllGorillaTagHats/releases/latest/). Although for the most up-to-date version of this pack you should click on [Download ZIP](https://github.com/GreenMan36/AllGorillaTagHats/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), you can then open the hats folder and copy everything in there to your Gorilla tag hats folder.
